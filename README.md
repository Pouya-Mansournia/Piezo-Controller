# Piezo-Controller
Presenting my groundbreaking project that seamlessly combines cutting-edge technologies to create an advanced Piezo Controller System. This remarkable achievement involved a comprehensive development process, starting with Proteus simulation and analog modeling, leading to the creation of the project within Altium Designer.

Powered by the STM32 microcontroller and harnessed by the STM32Cube IDE, this project redefines piezo stack control. With the ability to manipulate voltage across an impressive range from -30V to 150V, skillfully scaled to a digital spectrum of 0-3.3V, precision control has reached unprecedented levels.

The heart of the system lies in its closed-loop feedback mechanism, expertly interfacing with gauge sensors. This synergy between control and response ensures impeccable accuracy and optimal performance of the piezo stack.

Furthermore, the project's connectivity extends its impact. By establishing a seamless Ethernet connection to computers, it facilitates real-time data exchange and remote control capabilities, enhancing its utility and applicability.

This project is a testament to meticulous engineering and innovation. It represents a harmonious fusion of simulation, design, and microcontroller programming, resulting in a highly sophisticated Piezo Controller System with vast potential in research, industry, and beyond.
